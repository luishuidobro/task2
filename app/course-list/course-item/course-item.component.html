                Learn about where you can find course descriptions, 
                what information they include, how they work, 
                and details about various components of a course description. 
                Course descriptions report information about a university or college's classes. 
                They're published both in course catalogs that outline degree requirements and 
                in course schedules that contain descriptions for all courses offered 
                during a particular semester.
